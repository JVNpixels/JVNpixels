- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JVNpixels
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to code, it might even be my future career.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HaxeFlixel.
- ðŸ§  Iâ€™m (kind of) looking to collaborate on Friday Night Funkin' Projects. But I'm not that good so don't expect me to do wild things.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Just send me a notification I guess, I'm not always active though.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I made a fork of Psych Engine branded by me with ton's of features (that are kinda useless) but still good.
- âš¡ Fun fact 2: I am a big fan of Friday Night Funkin' and its been that way since late 2020 or early 2021.
