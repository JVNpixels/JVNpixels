- 👋 Hi, I’m @JVNpixels
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code, it might even be my future career.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HaxeFlixel.
- 💞️ I’m (kind of) looking to collaborate on Friday Night Funkin' Projects. But I'm not that good so don't expect me to do wild things.
- 📫 How to reach me: Just send me a notification I guess, I'm not always active though.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I made a fork of Psych Engine branded by me with ton's of features (that are kinda useless) but still good. Big fan of Friday Night Funkin' Since 2020.
